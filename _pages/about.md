\textbf{Wecome!}
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I study political behavior and psychology in American Politics, with specific interests in identity politics and threat response. My current project analyzes how high and low authoritarian Americans respond to the perceived threat of immigration.
